# Ignore rom folder, music folder, .pcm files, .exes, .sfcs, .smcs, .figs, .roms, .bins and .pycs
# Reasons:
# 	.pcm files are large, and are meant to be mirrored seperately from the Git project.
#       .exe files are mostly utilities for which I don't have the license, and I don't wish to complicate things with trying to include source code and/or LICENSE files.
#       .sfc, .smc, .rom, .bin and .fig files are the ROM images (patched and unpatched) themselves, and are therefore (other than the tester) copyrighted content.
#       .pycs are cached precompiled python files, and unneeded for distribution.
#       rom folder contains copyrighted content.
#       music folder will likely be empty, since it just contains pcms.
