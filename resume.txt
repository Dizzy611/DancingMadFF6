Higan v096/v097 add support for resuming tracks to the MSU-1, and Alpha 2 has been released to take advantage of this. *However*, the way manifest files (and thus games that use MSU-1 support) work in Higan v096 and later has changed drastically. As such, after re-patching and replacing program.rom, it is necessary to go into your %USERPROFILE%\Emulation\Super Famicom\ff3msu.sfc folder and rename ff3msu.msu to msu1.rom, and all of the ff3-#.pcm (where # is a track number) to track-#.pcm (where # is the same number), and *delete* the manifest.bml file. Higan v096/v097 now autodetect msu1 support if an msu1.rom exists but require a different filename standard. Alternatively, I have created a manifest.bml file that will trick Higan v097 at least (and v096, if you turn off "ignore manifests" in advanced settings) into loading the patch with current filenames. I can provide this on request *but will not be providing it here in bitbucket because this is a deprecated, hacky method*.
