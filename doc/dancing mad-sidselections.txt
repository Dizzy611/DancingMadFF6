Track by track (up to 2-01 when selection became binary):

1-01 Opening

OST .     (Baseline)
FFT ..    (Certain effects too loud, poorly mixed)
SSC ....  (Selected!)
OCR ...   (Too long by a full minute)


1-02 The Mines of Narshe

OST .     (Baseline)
FFT ..    (Poor mastering again, also an oddly placed "outro")
SSC ...   (Selected!)
OCR ..    (Completely different genre, doesn't fit, also too long)


1-03 Awakening

OST .     (Baseline)
FFT ....  (Selected!)
SSC ...   (Not too hot on the twinkly terra theme)
OCR ..    (Was almost beating FFT until the sudden genre shift to 80s Soft Rock around 2:00)


1-04 Locke

OST .     (Baseline)
FFT ...   (Selected!)
SSC ..    (Too much strings, too high pitched/whiny sounding, every string hit sounds like a million cats)
OCR       (What the hell is this? Very odd genre)


1-05 Battle

OST .     (Baseline)
FFT ..    (Hard decision between it and SSC, but slightly poor mastering on certain string hits)   
SSC ...   (Selected!)
OCR .     (Too epic, probably more suited for a boss theme honestly)


1-06 Fanfare

OST .     (Baseline)
FFT ..    (Again with the poor mastering :( FFT needs to lower his trumpets/brass)
SSC ...   (Selected!... Though honestly the trumpets are a bit loud in this too.)
OCR       (Neat, but vocals disqualify it immediately)


1-07 Edgar & Sabin

OST .     (Baseline)
FFT ..    (Not "regal" enough)
SSC ...   (Selected!)
OCR ..    (Too complex)


1-08 Kefka

OST .     (Baseline)
FFT ..    (Just not quite as sinister sounding as SSC version)
SSC ...   (Selected!)
OCR       (Sooo close to making it, but too quiet+vocals+sudden genre switch)


1-09 Mt Koltz

OST .     (Baseline)
FFT ..    (A bit muddy)
SSC ...   (Selected!)
OCR       (Wrong genre)


1-10 The Returners

OST .     (Baseline)
FFT ..    (Arguably a bit fast)
SSC ...   
OCR       (Wrong effing genre. Again. And vocals.)


1-11 Shadow

OST .     (Baseline)
FFT       (Guitar effect is just wrong, everything is too fairylike, not western enough.)
SSC ..    (Barely better than OST... Apparently this is a hard track to get right.)
OCR ...   (OCRemix's first win!)


1-12 Troops March On

OST .     (Baseline)
FFT ..    (Selected!)
SSC .     (Too quiet. Not bombastic enough.)
OCR       (Interesting, but wrong genre.)


1-13 Cyan/Cayenne

OST .     (Baseline)
FFT       (Not "japanese" enough)
SSC ..    (Selected!)
OCR -     (What the hell!? (Wrong genre, very wrong))


1-14 The Unforgiven

OST .     (Baseline)
FFT ...   (Selected!)
SSC ..    (Not quite bombastic enough)
OCR       (... No. (Wrong genre, again very much so))


1-15 The Phantom Forest/Mystic Forest

OST .     (Baseline)
FFT       (Not really feeling those vocal samples, FFT, Ah ah ah ah ah...)
SSC ..    (Pretty good, but not as good as OCR)
OCR ...   (Selected!) 


1-16 The Phantom Train

OST .     (Baseline)
FFT ..    (Brass seems a bit off sometimes)
SSC ...   (Selected!)
OCR       (Wrong genre)


1-17 Wild West (And then there were 3! No FFT for this and tracks after)

OST .     (Baseline)
SSC ..    (Selected!)
OCR       (Wrong genre)


1-18 Gau

OST .     (Baseline)
SSC ...   (Selected!)
OCR ..    (Very close, but not quite)


1-19 The Serpent Trench

OST .     (Baseline)
SSC ..    (Selected!)
OCR       (We don't want to *downgrade* the audio fidelity... No chiptunes kthx.)


1-20 Kids Run Through The City

OST .     (Baseline)
SSC ..    (Selected!)
OCR .     (Close but no cigar)


1-21 Under Martial Law

OST .     (Baseline)
SSC ..    (Selected!)
OCR       (Wrong genre)


1-22 Celes (no OCR here)

OST .     (Baseline)
SSC ..    (Selected!)


1-23 Save Them!

OST .     (Baseline)
SSC .     (Not sure, the strings are a bit whiny...)
OCR ..    (A bit different, but a definite improvement over OST)


1-24 The Decisive Battle

OST .     (Baseline)
SSC ..    (Great, but I fell in love with the OCR one during testing)
OCR ...   (Selected!)


1-25 Metamorphosis

OST .     (Baseline)
SSC ..    (Good, but..)
OCR ...   (Selected! Goes against my genre and vocal rules but... I dunno, I just think it's an awesome version!)

Selection for 1-25: OCR

2-01 Terra (From this point on, it's OST or OCR! Basically just voting on "does it improve upon the OST" at this point)

OST .     (Baseline)
OCR ..    (Selected!)

Selection for 2-01: OCR
