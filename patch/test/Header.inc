;------------------------------ Header File ---------------------------------
;   This is basically a combo of MarctheMER's and Neviksti's header files
; Perhaps reading their's will also help your understanding of the header,
; but I believe this will be the simplest method of defining your header,
; as Marc's doesn't provide a full explanation, and Neviksti's can be
; a bit more difficult for beginners (using the WLA directives is easier).
